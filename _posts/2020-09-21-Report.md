# Trial By Fire

Recently, I decided it was time to go down another Operating System (OS) rabbit hole and MacOS looked interesting enough especially since I knew little of the internals even though I regularly use Apple products. Learning a new OS is always an adventure, but I typically need a specific goal to ground my exploration and measure success in some way. Therefore, I set a goal of local exploitation through a single file being placed on a MacOS system and let the analysis challenge begin. After only a few weeks I came across an interesting bug related to property lists which this post goes into more detail about. The bug was reported to Apple in May 2020 and patched although no CVE was issued.

# Property List Background

Property lists are files that store serialized objects and are prevalant in Apple's Operating Systems similar to how Microsoft Windows uses the Registry to store configuration data. An example XML-based property list for the MacOS application Automator is shown below. This property list stores version information for the application as well as other useful data.

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
	<plist version="1.0">
	<dict>
		<key>BuildAliasOf</key>
		<string>Automator</string>
		<key>BuildVersion</key>
		<string>383</string>
		<key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key>
		<string>2.10</string>
		<key>CFBundleVersion</key>
		<string>492</string>
		<key>ProjectName</key>
		<string>Automator_executables</string>
		<key>SourceVersion</key>
		<string>492000000000000</string>
	</dict>
	</plist>

Property lists can also be in binary form otherwise known as bplists. As the name implies, these are property lists in a binary format that enable some additional object types and relationships including dictionaries. Below is an example bplist which can be identified by the 'bplist00' tag although additional tags exist to support other versions of the format.

The bplist format can be better understood by looking at [Apple's opensource code](https://opensource.apple.com/source/CF/CF-855.17/CFBinaryPList.c.auto.html) and I also found [this reference](https://medium.com/@karaiskc/understanding-apples-binary-property-list-format-281e6da00dbd) to be extremely helpful. The bplist format defined in Apple's opensource code is below.

Property lists provided an interesting target for fuzzing because they are simple to create and consumed by many parts of the OS including higher privileged processes. Apple's opensource code enabled me to create arbitrary bplists and start to fuzz the file format while ensuring proper syntax with the built-in MacOS plutil command-line tool. 


# Bug Hunting


I spent a few days generating bplists to exercise the format and quickly found that certain object types caused exceptions when being parsed by common MacOS binaries such as Finder and even higher privileged ones including Launch Services daemon (LSD). System crash logs indicated an issue in the Core Foundation framework but, as we will see later, this bug exists in multiple locations.

Most of the generated crashes appeared to be caused by how Core Foundation parses bplists and subsequently attempts to use the created objects. Any bplist that had objects within it's ObjectTable that were not string types (Date, Data, Bool, etc.) caused the parsing process to crash when calling non-existent string related selectors. The result was any process that used Core Foundation to read property lists could be crashed with an unrecognized selector exception. An example vulnerable code path is below:

    CFBundleGetMainBundle <-- exported function
     _CFBundleCreate
      CFBundleGetInfoDictionary
       _CFBundleRefreshInfoDictionaryAlreadyLocked
        _CFBundleCopyInfoDictionaryInDirectoryWithVersion
	 _CFBundleInfoPlistProcessInfoDictionary
	  CFStringFind
	   CFStringFindWithOptionsAndLocale
	    CRASH!!! <-- calls unrecognized selector

Reaching this location was trivial with the following C code and a malicious property list named Info.plist in the same directory as the test application.

    #import <CoreFoundation/CoreFoundation.h>
    int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
        CFBundleRef myAppsBundle= NULL;
        myAppsBundle = CFBundleGetMainBundle();
        return 0;
    }
    
# Crash Analysis

Generating crashes for this bug can be done programmatically or by placing a modified bplist on the system where it will automatically be parsed. In fact, one of the first signs of this bug was LSD repeatedly crashing on my system while trying to register an application with my modified property list. [Objective-See has a great blog post](https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x12.html) detailing application registration through LSD and the automatic parsing of property lists. The image below is Console output showing how often crashes occurred with a modified bplist on my desktop posing as a legitimate 'Info.plist'. Also note the User-level and System-level processes crashing.

<img src="/assets/images/Console.png" alt="">

Creating malicious bplists can be done by modifying a single byte to change an ASCII string object (type 0x5X) to another object type such as DATE (type 0x33). An example modified bplist is below.

This small one byte change can now be used to cause havoc on a MacOS system and presumably iOS although that platform was not tested during this research. This approach also impacts multiple databases including Spotlight's which becomes tainted with this malicious Info.plist and repeatedly causes crashes even after reboot.

### Getting to the root cause

With the ability to recreate crashes easily, I dug into where this bug actually lives. A simple approach to tracking this down was to look at the stack trace of a crashing process. Below is a crash log from the test application shown earlier that uses Core Foundation to read a malicious property list.

	2020-07-06 09:31:14.433 OpenInfo[79624:2895718] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[__NSDate length]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x7fa546d033e0'

It was helpful to [read the following](http://www.arigrant.com/blog/2013/12/13/a-selector-left-unhandled) article to understand how Core Foundation handles unrecognized selector exceptions and clarified what ***\_CF\_forwarding\_prep\_0*** in the stack trace does. With this information, I treated the return address before this as the likely source of the exception which is in ***CFStringFind*** ...specifically after a call to ***_CFStringGetLength***. The disassembly below illustrates this call.

<img src="/assets/images/CFStringFind.png" alt="">

I stepped through ***CFStringFind*** in LLDB until right before the call to ***\_CFStringGetLength*** to inspect the registers. From [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/1542853-cfstringgetlength?language=objc) for ***_CFStringGetLength*** we know that the first argument should be a string so we can inspect the RDI register with the following LLDB command.

	(lldb) po [$RDI class]
	__NSDate

Bingo! The object type for the first argument was not a string but instead an \_NSDate object from our malicious bplist. The decompilation of ***_CFStringGetLength*** below illustrates where this could go wrong. 

<img src="/assets/images/CFStringGetLength_Decompile.png" alt="">

We can see that the *length* selector is being called on the first argument to this function which we know will fail for an _NSDate object since it doesn't have this selector. This theory matches up with the crash logs as well. 

	reason: '-[__NSDate length]: unrecognized selector

If we continue through this function we will eventually hit an exception in the bowels of Objective-C exception handling which indicates we have found the root cause of these crashes.
	
### Additional Selectors

I continued to generate bplists with non-string objects and was able to generate additional crashes within Core Foundation from other unrecognized selectors. The crash log below is from LSD after consuming a malicious bplist with a single __NSCFData object.

	Uncaught exception: 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[__NSCFData _fastCStringContents:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x7fac7d49f560'
	
The stack trace for this LSD crash is as follows.

	Application Specific Backtrace 1:

Notice that the crashing location, before Objective-C exception handling, is not from ***CFStringFind*** but actually ***CFStringFindWithOptionsAndLocale*** which calls ***\_CFStringGetCStringPtrInternal*** finally dying a horrible death from the incorrect selector *_fastCStringContents* being called. The reason for this is that the \_\_NSCFData type actually has a *length* selector so it successfully gets past the first crashing location we saw earlier and further into Core Foundation until it calls another unrecognized selector.

### Multiple Bugs

Early in this research I was using plutil to generate crashes from malicious bplists before writing my own code to hit the necessary code paths. The following commands set up an LLDB session to start debugging this crash by using plutil as the target process and the print plist flag which will just print a human-readable version of the property list.

	(lldb) target create plutil
	(lldb) process launch --stop-at-entry -- -p bad.plist


After stepping through execution a few times, it was evident that plutil actually crashes in a different location and NOT in Core Foundation. The output below illustrates that it attempts to call the *length* selector on an __NSDate type which causes an unrecognized selector exception but this bug lives in plutil and not in Core Foundation. 

	* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 3.1
	    frame #0: 0x0000000100006aa0 plutil`___lldb_unnamed_symbol67$$plutil + 21
	plutil`___lldb_unnamed_symbol67$$plutil:

	    0x100006ab1 <+38>: movq   %rax, %r15
	Target 1: (plutil) stopped.
	(lldb) po [$rdi class]
	__NSDate
	
It appears similar bugs exist in many MacOS applications that assume bplists will only contain string object types. The stacktrace from a crashed LSD process is below which is also outside of Core Foundation.

If we use GHIDRA to disassemble the ***_LSPlistCompactString*** function, we can see that offset 45 or 0x2D gets us to yet another *length* call on the incorrect object type presumably from our malicious bpliist which is now in the LSD database. 

<img src="/assets/images/LPListCompact.png" alt="">

We can verify this by setting a breakpoint on ***_LSPlistCompactString*** and printing the first argument with the following breakpoint commands.
	
	(lldb) br com add 1
	Enter your debugger command(s).  Type 'DONE' to end.
	> po [$rdi class] 
	> c
	> DONE

The output below illustrates that LSD is getting our __NSDate object from the malicious bplist.
	
	Command #2 'c' continued the target.
	(lldb)  po [$rdi class]
	NSTaggedPointerString
	(lldb)  c
	Process 576 resuming
	
	Command #2 'c' continued the target.
	(lldb)  po [$rdi class]
	__NSDate

This confirms what I thought was intially one bug is actually many across multiple MacOS binaries and all rooted in the assumption that bplists only contain string objects.


# Impact Summary
- Root-level processes can be crashed from a normal User account and repeatedly crash if they are respawned by the Operating System (LSD and MDS are examples)
- System instability and denial of service occur especially when Finder or other UI related processes consume the malicious bplist and crash
- 0-clicks required to crash processes since application bundles, packages etc. are automatically processed when they are written to disk
- Potential to crash security-related processes from normal User accounts to remove security boundaries (XProtect, etc.) although they were not fully explored in this post
- Potential to exploit remotely in scenarios where bplists are parsed automatically
- System components impacted by this bug include any that use Core Foundation to parse bplists which is a large percentage (a quick search found over 1000 installed binaries on MacOS 10.15.3 that import functions to reach this bug)
- Many applications parse bplist data through Core Foundation but also access generated objects incorrectly within their own code meaning the bug count could be much larger

# Conclusions

Hopefully this exploration was as interesting and helpful to the community as it was for my own understanding of MacOS internals. Shout out to the Apple security community which is extremely passionate and informative about poking at Apple products. There is some follow-on work to this post which will hopefully be published in the coming months. As always, feedback is welcome including corrections to any inaccuracies or suggestions for more effective ways to accomplish the same goals.
